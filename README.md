My Library of Verilog Modules and Functions

Most of these modules are practice / implementations based on the book "Embedded SoPC Design with Nios II Processor and Verilog Examples"

They are made to simulate on a DE10 Lite FPGA using Quartus

UART Transmitter 

## Below some simulation images (UART Transmitter & Edge Detector Verification).
